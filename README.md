These scripts can generate results in our manuscript entitled "Mapping Genome-wide Structural Variations of 106 Maize Lines with Nanopore Sequencing". Here are six main sections of analyses included in this study:

1. Short-read sequencing data processing
2. ONT long-read data processing
3. RNA-seq data processing
4. Population genetics analyses
5. SV genomic feature annotation 
6. Synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs

## Tutorial

All dependencies and tutorials for conducting the analyses were explained in the corresponding Readme.md file. To report any problem, feel free to start an github issue or send an email to Beibei Xin at bxin@cau.edu.cn or Junpeng Shi at shijunpeng@cau.edu.cn.
